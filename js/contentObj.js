                    content:`<p>More than a million homes have already gone solar in the U.S., and many more homeowners are considering installing solar. If you’re in the market for solar, you probably want to know what actually happens during a solar panel installation. There are five big steps that need to happen after you sign your solar contract before the solar panels on your roof can actually power your home, and a lot of it is behind the scenes. To show you what you can expect, we’ve outlined a simple five-step guide for the typical solar installation process.

                            <p>It’s always good to start with a broad overview. Start out by watching EnergySage’s time-lapse video, Solar Installation in Less Than a Minute, which shows one of EnergySage’s pre-screened solar installers assemble a 6.7 kW solar energy system on a home in Newton, Massachusetts. The happy homeowners now save $2,250 on their electricity bills every year thanks to their new solar panels, and will break even on their investment in just five years.
                            </p>

                            <p>Installing solar panels doesn’t happen overnight – there’s a process for what needs to happen to get your panels ready to begin powering your home. Overall, from the day you sign your contract with your installer, it will typically take between one and three months before your solar panels are grid-connected and producing energy for your home.
                            </p>
                            <p>The contract you sign should spell out all the details of financing, ownership, and performance expectations. Also, because these systems can include web-enabled devices, you should check if anyone is collecting data on your home energy production and usage and who has access to it.That’s a lot of details to keep in mind. IREC collected some additional resources that dive into greater detail. When in doubt, don’t go it alone, Weissman says: “If you’re not getting the answers that you need, then it’s probably best to seek some legal advice.”

                A small-scale wind turbine can be connected to the electricity grid through your power provider or it can stand alone (off-grid). Small-scale wind energy, often referred to as microgeneration, enables homes, farms, businesses and public facilities to off-set all or a portion of on-site electricity consumption. Small-scale wind turbines are very different than larger utility-scale wind turbines which are often grouped in wind farms and widely used by utilities and other power producers across Canada. 
This makes wind energy an option for remote communities that are not connected to the provincial or territorial grid. In fact, the use of wind energy in remote areas can often help reduce the use of diesel generators, saving fuel costs and reducing pollution.<p>

               <p> Several provinces have programs for individuals and businesses who want to generate using small-scale or microgeneration wind turbines. Visit the links below for further information.  </p>`

                    Rain energy from a solar panel
                    Soochow University researchers create solar cell that harvests energy from raindrops

                    The team from Soochow University built a sandwich-style device incorporating a top layer of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), with a  PV solar cell. A transparent electrode between the layers allows sunlight to pass freely to the solar cell below.

                    <p>Because the TENG and electrode layers are clear, the base solar cell operates at close to standard efficiency. But falling raindrops create static friction, which generates additional voltage, boosting the device’s energy output.

                    By etching microscopic grooves into the surface of the top triboelectric layer and electrode, the researchers found they could also trap more sunlight and improve raindrop interactions.

                    In testing, the solar cell demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 13.6 per cent. Then  the team used simulated rainfall to test the output from the nanogenerating layers. Water drops falling at a rate of one per second from five centimetres up generated 2.14 volts of electricity.

                    Rain energy: Rainy day solar could roll out in 3-5 years
                    The amount of power the device generates from falling rain is too low to revolutionise the solar industry anytime soon. But researchers say a prototype capable of producing hundreds of volts could be available in 3-5 years.

                    A significant application could be the weaving of rain-harvesting solar devices into clothing.

                    In the meantime, households must make do with tried-and-tested rooftop and ground mount solar panels.
